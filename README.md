## My time
A time-management system based on the Pomodoro technique using Firebase and AngularJs.


### Pomodoro technique
The Pomodoro Technique aims to increase work productivity and quality. In its simplest form, it times work in 25-minute intervals, with five-minute breaks in between.

During a 25-minute session, users only focus on a task. During a break, users do not do anything related to work.

### How it works
My Time manages the Pomodoro sessions. When time is up, it will alert you with "Ding" sound.
